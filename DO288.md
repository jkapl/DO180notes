# Red Hat OpenShift Development I: Containerizing Applications

## Source-to-Image
Help: <br>`oc new-app -h`<br>
New app from source repo<br>
`oc new-app -i php:7.0 --strategy source --code http://github.com/repo --context-dir some-directory`<br>
Previously created container image:<br>
`oc new-app --docker-image quay.io/myimage`<br>
<br>S2I Creates:
- build config
- image stream
- deployment config
- service

Labels resources `app=app-name`


Can call oc new-app multiple times to create multicontainer application

Inspect output of new-app command without creating resources:<br>
`oc new-app -o json quay.io/my-image`

What is an image stream and why use it:
An image stream resource points to a container image either in the internal registry or in an external registry, and stores metadata such as available tags and image content checksums. Having container image metadata in an image stream allows OpenShift to perform operations, such as image caching, based on this data instead of going to a registry server every time. It also allows using either notification or pooling strategies to react to image content updates. Build configurations and deployment configurations use image stream events to trigger new deployments when the app image is updated in an external registry.

Import an image stream:<br>
`oc import-image myimage --confirm --from quay.io/my-image --insecure`<br>
Describe an image stream:<br>
`oc describe is my-image-stream`

Start a new build if the source changes. Starting new build takes the configuration from oc new-app and runs the build again using the specified builder image and source repository<br>
`oc start-build build-config-name`

## Templates
`oc new-app --template <namespace>/<template>`

## Creating Dockerfiles

#### Managing Layers
Minimize the number of layers. The RUN, COPY and ADD instruction create layers. Use the && separator to execute multiple commands within one RUN instruction, thereby creating only one additional image layer:
```
RUN yum --disablerepo=* --enablerepo="rhel-7-server-rpms" && \
    yum update && \
    yum install -y httpd && \
    yum clean all -y
```
As an example, a RUN instruction that installs required dependencies, followed by another RUN instruction that cleans up the cache from the install will not remove the files created by the previous RUN command as each layer is read only. It will only obscure the files in the container filesystem but the image size will remain the same.

#### WORKDIR instruction
Specifies where the RUN, CMD, COPY, ADD and ENTRYPOINT commands will execute

#### USER Instruction
The user instruction is <i>not honored</i> by default by OCP. OCP uses a random user id instead of root(0) to run the container. However, within the Docker file, you can use the root user to install packages. This is because a build environment is treated very differently from an execution environment. Build environments are ephemeral and therefore are allowed some root permissions during build.

Although the user id used to run the container process will be generated randomly, we can expect it to be a part of the user group root. So if a location in the container file system needs to be writable, we just have to make sure it is writable to group root and make sure the location has group write permissions. Same with executable files in the container: make them accessible and executable to the group root:

```
RUN chgrp -R 0 directory && \
    chmod -R g=u directory
```
Tl;dr - the container will be run by a non root process. Therefore it won't have access to the container file system unless the filesystem has been modified to permit GROUP root to access it.


In the case where a container does need to run as root (a container that needs to have access to the host network for debugging purposes for instance) we can use Security Context Constraints (SCCs), which control the actions a pod can perform. OCP ships with several SCCs. The anyuid SCC allows containers to run as root.

Create a Service Account (identity) and assign it to the Pod either directly or by a deployment config, then assign a priviledged SCC, like anyuid, to the Service Account.
```
oc create serviceaccount myserviceaccount
oc patch dc/demo-app --patch '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"serviceAccountName": "myserviceaccount"}}}}'
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z myserviceaccount
```
Also note that ports below 1024 are priviledged and cannot be used by containers not running as root. So if a webserver is set up to listen on port 80, the container will fail. In this case add a RUN command to your Dockerfile:
```
RUN sed -i "s/Listen 80/Listen 8080/g" /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
```
And following OCP security protocol, if the web server process, which will be running with a random user id belonging to group root, needs access to files in the container, modify those files by adding them to the root group:
```
RUN chgrp -R 0 /var/log/httpd /var/run/httpd && \
    chmod -R g=u /var/log/httpd /var/run/httpd
```
or equivalently:
```
RUN chgrp -R 0 /var/log/httpd /var/run/httpd && \
    chmod -R 777 /var/log/httpd /var/run/httpd
```

#### ONBUILD instruction
Images that use a base image with ONBUILD instructions have those instructions executed before the instructions in the child image Docker file. Essentially, ONBUILD instructions run when a child image is created. Used to set defaults for child images.

## Injecting Data

### Config Maps and Secrets

Secrets are essentially base64 encoded config maps. In addition secrets are never stored on disk in the node, only in memory. Config maps can be stored in memory (mounted as a volume). Several types of secrets:
- opaque: simplest type, just key-value pair
- other types: service-account-token, basic-auth, ssh-auth, tls. All of these perform some kind of validation against the data

Be careful when checking base64 encoded strings for the newline character.
`echo -n mypassword | base64` returns the base64 encoding of mypassword without the newline character.

Create a config map:
```
oc create cm appconfig --from-literal=APP_MSG="Hello Joel"
```

#### Setting environment variables from config maps and secrets
This command will take each of the key value pairs from the appcfg config map and assign the key as the environment variable and the value as its value. Same with secrets:
```
oc set env dc/myapp --from cm/appcfg
oc set env dc/myapp --from secrets/secretdata
```
Each time environment variables are set or updated in a deployment configuration using config maps or secrets, a new deployment will rollout as the pod template has changed. In order to pause auto rollouts:
```
oc set triggers dc/mydcname --from-config --remove
# now make the changes to the deployment config
oc rollout latest mydcname
# then reenable the triggers
oc set triggers dc/mydcname --from-config
```
Sample code mounting secret data into a volume:
```
oc set volume dc/application --add -t secret -m /opt/app-root/secure --name myappsec-vol --secret-name security
```
^^Create a volume mounted at this directory, give the volume a name, and specify the name of the secret to pull

## Publishing Enterprise Container Images

### Skopeo, Authenticating to Private Image Registries
<b>Skopeo</b> can move images from one registry to another and scan remote images without using a container engine, thereby using fewer compute resources. It will use the same auth.json file created by the podman login command, or can be passed credentials on the command line. Use the `read` command to pass creds without storing them in command line history. To authenticate and then inspect an image at the Red Hat registry:
```
read -p "PASSWORD: " -s password
PASSWORD:
skopeo inspect --creds myusername:$password docker://registry.redhat.io/rhscl/postgresql
```

Several service accounts by default in OCP:
- default
- builder
- deployer

In order to pull images from a private registry for use in building new images and pushing them to local registry, or for pulling images and deploying them in OCP, you need to create a secret and link it to the necessary service accounts.

Create a docker-registry type secret:
```
oc create secret docker-registry registrycreds --docker-server registry.example.com --docker-username youruser --docker-password yourpassword
```

Create a secret from a preexisting auth token:
```
oc create secret generic registrycreds --from-file .dockerconfigjson=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json --type kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
```

Then link the secret to the necessary SA:
```
oc secrets link default registrycreds --for pull
```
For builder image:
```
oc secrets link builder registrycreds
```

### OpenShift Internal Registry

OpenShift internal registry can be exposed via a route:
```
oc patch config cluster -n openshift-image-registry --type merge -p '{"spec":{"defaultRoute":true}}'
```
Can use login token from OpenShift as password to login to registry as if it were an external registry. Get token with `oc whoami -t`

### Image Streams

One of the big differences between K8s and OCP

Allows you to group similar images. For example, could have an image stream 'my app' with different labels for test and prod images.

My App image stream
| Tag | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
|my-app:prod | production|
|my-app:test | test |
|my-app:vendor | points to vendor image repository |
|my-app:team1 | points to internal image registry hosting team 1's version |
|my-app:team2 | points to internal image registry hosting team 2's version|



- my-app:prod
- my-app:test
- my-app:vendor
- my-app:team1
- my-app:team2

Create new image stream from a public registry with 
```
> oc import image nameofstream:tag --confirm --from registry/org/myimage:tag
```

Create new image stream from a private registry with 
```
> podman login -u myuser registry.example.com
> oc create secret generic regtoken --from-file .dockerconfigjson=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json --type kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
> oc import-image myis --confirm --from registry.example.com/myorg/myimage
```
Don't have to associate the secret with a particular service account. `oc import-image` automatically searches secrets for the one matching the registry host name.

Create a shared project to share image streams across projects:
```
$ podman login -u myuser registry.example.com
$ oc project shared
$ oc create secret generic regtoken --from-file .dockerconfigjson=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json --type kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
// the next command with tag reference-policy local ensures that the imported image is cached in the internal registry so that projects that reference this image stream do not need to authenticate to the external registry
$ oc import-image myis --confirm --reference-policy local --from registry.example.com/myorg/myimage
// add the image-puller role to all the service accounts in the myapp project
$ oc policy add-role-to-group system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts:myapp
$ oc project myapp
$ oc new-app -i shared/myis
```

## Builds

### BuildConfig Resource
Generated by `oc new-app` command

Requires:
- build strategy:
  - source
  - pipeline
  - docker
  - custom
- input source

Sample command:
```
oc new-app --name=jhost --build-env MAVEN_MIRROR_URL=http://someserver -i redhat-openjdk18-openshift:1.5 https://githubURLofSourceRepo --context-dir=directory-where-source-is
```

### Debugging
Retrieve file from pod:<br>`oc cp <pod-name>:<file-dir>`<br>
Copy local files to or from container:<br>`oc rsync <source> <destination> [-c <container>]`<br>
Start interactive remote shell inside container:<br>`oc rsh -t <pod-name>`<br>
Follow logs with -f:<br>`oc logs -f bc/greet`<br>
Make sure service endpoints match target pod IP:
```
oc describe svc <service-name> | grep Endpoints
oc describe pod <target-pod> | grep IP
```
